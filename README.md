# Voting-Smart-Contract
This project introduces a straightforward Ethereum smart contract for conducting voting processes. 
Users can participate in the voting by submitting their choices through the contract, which securely 
records their votes on the blockchain. 
The contract ensures transparency and integrity by preventing double voting and tampering with the results.
